ModDamage-
=========
A unique comprehensive event manipulation control plugin for the Bukkit project geared towards damage-related mechanics.

ModDamage's only true goal is to offer the greatest amount of customization possible without a tricky, cramped,
or otherwise unintuitive method of configuration for a Bukkit game server.
ModDamage offers a very easy-to-read and granulated method of changing damage-related events without the need
for a programmer making modifications for common ingame evaluations.
