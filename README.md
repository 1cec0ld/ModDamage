ModDamage
=========
A unique comprehensive damage control plugin for the Bukkit project. 

ModDamage's only true goal is to offer the greatest amount of customization possible without a tricky, cramped, or otherwise unintuitive method of configuration for a Bukkit game server.
ModDamage offers a very granulated approached to damage-mechanic configuration, starting from the server level and working towards specific groups and mob type in Minecraft.
