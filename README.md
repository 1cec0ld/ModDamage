ModDamage
=========
A unique comprehensive event manipulation plugin for the Bukkit project, geared towards damage-related mechanics.

ModDamage's only true goal is to offer the greatest amount of event control possible without a tricky, cramped,
or otherwise unintuitive method of configuration.
It offers an easy-to-read and granulated solution for changing damage mechanics in common evaluative situations on the fly.
